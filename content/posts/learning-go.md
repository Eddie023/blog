### Learning Go
I have been doing node/react professionally for more than 2 years. Initially, it was great fun to use javascript and it's framework. However, after almost 2 years, I started feeling a little bored. Programming was more about finishing a JIRA ticket than enjoying building new stuffs. So, I wanted to challenge myself by learning a new programming language-- learning Go was something I was craving for some time and finally felt like I should give it a try.
