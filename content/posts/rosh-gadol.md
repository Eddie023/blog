## Rosh Gadol
Rosh Gadol is a Hebrew word for "big head", which interestingly is a positive term meaning
the a person who is capable of seeing the big picture, of taking responsibility and initiative, of demonstrating leadership
and of going beyond the job description to accomplish the goal.

The Israeli Military use this reference to filter out people who are leaders from subservient.
I found this concept interesting and did some more reading in the Internet. Coincidentally came up with this [developer vs programmer](https://ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html).
